            <h1>AIESEC</h1>
            <p>
              AIESEC is an international non-profit youth organization, and
              it was an honor for me to be a part of this great community.
              It is a great place for professional development, and there is
              a great corporate culture. During my terms in the positions of
              Marketing Department team member, Conference Committee President
              and Project Manager, I learned lots of lessons on how to lead a
              team, to organize a workflow of the project and how to make long-term
              strategic planning. It is a place where you can develop your leadership potential!

            <h1>Sample Mag</h1>
            <p>
              SAMPLE Mag is the first ever fashion magazine in Nazarbayev University.
              It is a community of people, who are not indifferent towards the world
              of fashion and who want to highlight the significance of fashion in the
              world economy, as well as our everyday lives. We write articles, we make
              conceptual photoshoots, we design our magazine layouts, but also we assist
              in the photo/videoshoots organized by other clubs, and recently we conducted
              our first ever upcycling contest, followed by a fashion show.
