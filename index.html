            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              I am just an ordinary humanities student, who is taking CSCI 111
              Web Programming course and trying her best to pass it. Even though
              my head nearly exploded couple of times this semester, the course
              seems very fun and useful, because now I know how websites work and
              the tasks like this are not scary anymore.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The next sections are just a dull text that is there to demonstrate
              the feature that shows and hides the big text by clicking the button, 
              so you do not have to read it at all. Unless you have nothing to do
              and you have a rebellious spirit that wants to read it anyway. Or you
              really like how I write. I highly doubt it, you might just be bored.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Bruh I just said that this text makes no sense, why are you following along?
              Don't you have a family? Any hobbies? You could have just skimmed it, instead
              of spending the precious minutes of your life on a random text that has no
              informational value whatsoever. I just hated the look of that "Lorem Ipsum" text
              and added a little bit of my wit and humour, but still you don't have to read it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Okay, since you have stayed this long, I think you deserve a reward. This is the
              feature you have been waiting for. Get ready...in three...two...one...
            </p>
            <button class="button" id="show" onclick="showMore()">
              Show more...

            <div id="js">
              <h1>Ka-Boom!</h1>
              <p>
                Surprise! Excited? Congratulations, the focus is over and you can go home, I have
                no more interesting stuff to offer I guess. My creativity ended this very minute
                you clicked the button.

              <p>
                Okay, I will add one more paragraph in this section. But that is all, after that
                you will have to look at the Lorem Ipsum Text
